What is HLD, Explain?

High-Level Design (HLD) is a phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC) where the overall architecture and structure of
a software system or application are planned and documented comprehensively.

It is an essential step that bridges the gap between the requirements specification and the actual implementation of the system.
The goal of HLD is to provide a blueprint or roadmap for how the system will function and how its various components willÂ interact.
